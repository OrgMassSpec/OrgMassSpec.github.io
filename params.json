{"name":"OrgMassSpec.github.io","tagline":"Mass Spectrometry Data Analysis","body":"# OrgMassSpecR\r\n\r\nOrgMassSpecR is an extension for the [R](http://www.r-project.org/) statistical computing language. It contains functions to assist with organic/biological mass spectrometry data analysis. Mass spectral libraries are included as companion packages.\r\n\r\nThis project is under continuous development. The stable version is on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OrgMassSpecR/index.html). The development version is on [GitHub](https://github.com/nathandodder/OrgMassSpecR).\r\n\r\nExamples are in the package vignette [(PDF)](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OrgMassSpecR/vignettes/OrgMassSpecR-examples.pdf).\r\n\r\n## Functions\r\n\r\n### General\r\n* `MolecularWeight`: Calculate the molecular weight of an organic molecule.\r\n* `MonoisotopicMass`: Calculate the monoisotopic mass or monoisotopic m/z value of an organic molecule.\r\n* `IsotopicDistribution`: Simulate the isotopic distribution of an organic molecule.\r\n* `ListFormula`: Convert a character string representing an elemental formula to a list representing the elemental formula.\r\n* `DrawChromatogram`: Plot a chromatogram, color the area under specified peak(s), and calculate the peak area(s).\r\n* `SpectrumSimilarity`: Generate a head-to-tail plot of two mass spectra and calculate a similarity score.\r\n* `ConvertConcentration`: Change the unit basis for a sample concentration, such as ng/g wet weight to ng/g dry weight, or pg/g lipid weight to pg/g wet weight.\r\n* `RetentionIndex`: Calculate the the non-isothermal gas chromatographic retention index of a target compound.\r\n* `DeadVolume`: Calculate the internal volume of a defined length of tubing.\r\n* `FlowTime`: Calculate the time required for a liquid to flow through a defined length of tubing.\r\n\r\n### Spectral Libraries\r\n* `LibraryReport`: Generate a PDF report of an OrgMassSpecR mass spectral library, or view spectra within R. Each spectral library package has its own LibraryReport function.\r\n* `ReadMspDirectory`: Reads in all .msp files within a directory and makes a single concatenated data frame of m/z values and intensities.\r\n* `ReadMspFile`: Reads in a .msp file and makes a data frame of m/z values and intensities.\r\n* `WriteMspFile`: Writes a single .msp file from a data frame of m/z values and intensities of multiple mass spectra.\r\n\r\n### Proteins/Peptides\r\n* `Digest`: Cleave an amino acid sequence (a protein or peptide) according to enzyme specific rules and calculate the precursor ion m/z values.\r\n* `FragmentPeptide`: Determine the b- and y-ions or c- and z-ions produced by the fragmentation of a peptide by tandem mass spectrometry.\r\n* `ConvertPeptide`: Convert single amino acid codes to an elemental formula or three letter codes.\r\n* `PeptideSpectrum`: Plot a peptide fragmentation mass spectrum, with the b- and y-ions or c- and z-ions identified.\r\n* `IsotopicDistributionN`: Simulate the isotopic distribution of a peptide with varying amounts of nitrogen-15 incorporation.\r\n* `IsotopicDistributionHDX`: Simulate the isotopic distribution of a peptide undergoing hydrogen-deuterium exchange.\r\n* `ExchangeableAmides`: Determine the number of backbone amide hydrogens given a protein/peptide sequence.  Used in hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n### Introductory Manuscripts\r\n\r\n**Mass Spectral Libraries**\r\n\r\nHoh E, Dodder NG, Lehotay SJ, Pangallo KC, Reddy CM, Maruya KA, \"Nontargeted Comprehensive Two-Dimensional Gas Chromatography/Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry Method and Software for Inventorying Persistent and Bioaccumulative Contaminants in Marine Environments\", __Environmental Science and Technology__, **2012**, 46, 8001-8008 (DOI: 10.1021/es301139q).\r\n\r\n**Calculation of MRM Transitions and Isotopic Distributions of Nitrogen-15 Labeled Peptides**\r\n\r\nLiao WL, Heo GY, Dodder NG, Pikuleva IA, Turko IV, \"Optimizing the Conditions of a Multiple Reaction Monitoring Assay for Membrane Proteins: Quantification of Cytochrome P450 11A1 and Adrenodoxin Reductase in Bovine Adrenal Cortex and Retina\", __Analytical Chemistry__, **2010**, 82, 5760-5767 (DOI: 10.1021/ac100811x).\r\n\r\n### Manuscripts Using OrgMassSpecR\r\n\r\nThe following link to searches by publisher.\r\n\r\n[ACS Publications](http://pubs.acs.org/action/doSearch?action=search&searchText=OrgMassSpecR&qsSearchArea=searchText)\r\n\r\n[Elsevier Publications](http://www.sciencedirect.com) (Search for OrgMassSpecR in All Fields)\r\n\r\n[Springer Publications](http://link.springer.com/search?query=OrgMassSpecR)\r\n\r\n[The Journal of Biological Chemistry](http://www.jbc.org/search?author1=&fulltext=OrgMassSpecR&pubdate_year=&volume=&firstpage=&submit=yes)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at http://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n-->\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
